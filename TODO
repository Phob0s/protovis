data/Transform.js
- documentation

layout/Layout.js
- use private data, or at least standardize which attributes are populated
- rename: x -> left, y -> top, angle -> textAngle?

layout/Force.js
- copy: x -> left, y -> top
- example with interactive filtering of links and nodes

layout/Network.js

behavior/Pan.js
- lock one axis
- specify bounds on panning

behavior/Zoom.js

- specify bounds on zoom level
- non-uniform zooms (e.g., in time series, zoom time dimension only)?

physics/Simulation.js
- use a constraint rather than `fixed` property to allow dragging?

physics/LinkConstraint.js
- should support an alpha parameter, like pv.Constraint.position

scene/*
- use array push rather than string concatentation to improve performance?

text/CsvFormat.js
- return an object with a .format method, or the format function?
- should other Formats return a function with a self-reference .format method?

*
- use Object.create instead of pv.extend, if available
