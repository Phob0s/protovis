/**
 * Constructs a new, empty arc layout. Layouts are not typically constructed
 * directly; instead, they are added to an existing panel via
 * {@link pv.Mark#add}.
 *
 * @class Represents a layout for arc diagrams. An arc diagram is a network
 * visualization with a one-dimensional layout of nodes, using circular arcs to
 * render links between nodes. For undirected networks, arcs are rendering on a
 * single side; this makes arc diagrams useful as annotations to other
 * two-dimensional network layouts, such as rollup, matrix or table layouts. For
 * directed networks, links in opposite directions can be rendered on opposite
 * sides using <tt>directed(true)</tt>.
 *
 * <p>Arc layouts are particularly sensitive to node ordering; for best results,
 * order the nodes such that related nodes are close to each other. A poor
 * (e.g., random) order may result in large arcs with crossovers that impede
 * visual processing. A future improvement to this layout may include automatic
 * reordering using, e.g., spectral graph layout or simulated annealing.
 *
 * <p>This visualization technique is related to that developed by
 * M. Wattenberg, <a
 * href="http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/arc-diagrams.pdf">"Arc
 * Diagrams: Visualizing Structure in Strings"</a> in <i>IEEE InfoVis</i>, 2002.
 * However, this implementation is limited to simple node-link networks, as
 * opposed to structures with hierarchical self-similarity (such as strings).
 *
 * <p>As with other network layouts, three mark prototypes are provided:<ul>
 *
 * <li><tt>node</tt> - for rendering nodes; typically a {@link pv.Dot}.
 * <li><tt>link</tt> - for rendering links; typically a {@link pv.Line}.
 * <li><tt>label</tt> - for rendering node labels; typically a {@link pv.Label}.
 *
 * </ul>For more details on how this layout is structured and can be customized,
 * see {@link pv.Layout.Network}.
